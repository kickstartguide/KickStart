Mechanical Engineering

Fluid Mechanics:
Fluid Mechanics is the study of fluids at rest (fluid statics) and in motion (fluid dynamics).
A fluid is defined as a substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress regardless of the magnitude of the applied stress. Whereas a solid can resist an applied force by static deformation.

Deformation of a solid and a fluid exposed to an applied force
Liquids, gases, plasma and, to some extent, plastic solids are accepted to be fluids. A perfect fluid offers no internal resistance to change in shape and, consequently, they take on the shape of their containers. Liquids form a free surface (that is, a surface not created by their container) whereas gases and plasmas do not, but, instead, they expand and occupy the entire volume of the container.

Theory of Machine:
The subject Theory of Machines may be defined as that branch of Engineering-science, which deals with the study of relative motion between the various parts of a machine, and forces which act on them. The knowledge of this subject is very essential for an engineer in designing the various parts of a machine.

Thermodynamics:
Thermodynamics is heart of mechanical engineering. Be it any processes or any engines, all follow some or the other thermodynamics laws.
Mechanical engineering can be broadly think as a branch which accumulates the study of Automobiles, Refrigeration, Power plants, Heat transfer, machine design, strength of materials and metallurgical processes.

Strength of Materials:
Strength of materials, also called mechanics of materials, is a subject which deals with the behavior of solid objects subject to stresses and strains. The complete theory began with the consideration of the behavior of one and two dimensional members of structures, whose states of stress can be approximated as two dimensional, and was then generalized to three dimensions to develop a more complete theory of the elastic and plastic behavior of materials. An important founding pioneer in mechanics of materials was Stephen Timoshenko.
The study of strength of materials often refers to various methods of calculating the stresses and strains in structural members, such as beams, columns, and shafts. The methods employed to predict the response of a structure under loading and its susceptibility to various failure modes takes into account the properties of the materials such as its yield strength, ultimate strength, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio; in addition the mechanical element's macroscopic properties (geometric properties), such as its length, width, thickness, boundary constraints and abrupt changes in geometry such as holes are considered.

Refrigeration and Air-Conditioner:
Refrigeration is a process of removing heat from a low-temperature reservoir and transferring it to a high-temperature reservoir. The work of heat transfer is traditionally driven by mechanical means, but can also be driven by heat, magnetism, electricity, laser, or other means. Refrigeration has many applications, including, but not limited to: household refrigerators, industrial freezers, cryogenics, and air conditioning.
Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A/C) is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space, to improve the comfort of occupants. Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans or animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and even to display and store artwork.
