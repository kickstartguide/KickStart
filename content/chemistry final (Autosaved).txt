1. Organic Chemistry
Organic Chemistry involves the study branch of chemistry dealing with the effect of carbon with living things. This type of chemistry also concern the study of the structure integrity, behaviors, ingredients, reactivity, and initiation of carbon-making elements, which involve not only hydrogens but also elements with any size of another chemicals, including oxygen (most elements consists of at least one carbon–peroxide bond).
Organical elements are founded on the theories about chemistry of carbon. Carbon is primary in the variety of reason and to the expand of structures integrity that can bring upon the effects from the dimensional interconnections of its atoms. The process of photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and water to oxygen and chemical elements known as peroxides. Both cellular activity also involves in the making of the substance that gives structural rigidity to plants and tree.
Meanwhile, there are a few sub-branches of Organic chemistry and will be explain below:
2. Stereochemistry
Stereochemistry is a study about molecules in three dimensions- that is how atoms in a molecule are arranged in a space relative to the other. Three aspect about stereochemistry are:
1. Geometric Isomers : how rigidity in molecule could cause isomerism
2. Conformation of Molecules: the shape and how a form could be change
3. Chirality of Molecules : how the structure of right or left around carbon atoms could cause isomerism

This volume is devoted entirely to inorganic and organometallic stereochemical subjects. Discusses the systematic notations that have been developed to satisfy the needs for a rational and systematic stereochemical nomenclature. Reviews the stereochemical aspects of the changes of bonding at carbon centers induced by metals, either catalytically or stoiciometrically. Also reviews the major achievements in current stereochemical research—the synthesis of asymmetric compounds mediated by transition metals.

Topics in Stereochemistry, previously edited by "the father of stereochemistry" Ernest L. Eliel, is a longstanding, successful series covering the most important advances in the field. The much-anticipated Volume 26 on stereochemical aspects of organolithium compounds includes chapters on the following topics:

Just like how your left foot doesn't quite fit your right shoe, molecules also can have properties that depend on their handedness! This property is called chirality. We will go over what makes a molecule chiral, stereoisomer, assigning configurations using the R,S system, optical activity and Fischer projections.

3. Organometallic Chemistry
Organometallic was developed by Louis C. Cadet in synthesizing methyl arsenic compound but the ultimate recognition of organometallic as a culminated subfield was in Ernst Fischer and Geoffrey Wilkinson earned Nobel Prizes for work of Metallocenes. Organometallic chemistry is a study about chemical compound contains at least one bond between metal and carbon atom of an organic compounds, the term metal element in this compounds includes elements like silicon, or boron which not actually a metal but metalloids.
Organometallic compound is defined as a compound in which carbon is bonded directly to a metallic atom, the examples of organometallic compounds are mercury, zinc, lead, magnesium or lithium and as mention above metalloids. Organomettalic compounds are also found naturally, some of them are hazardous for human life such as organolead and organomercury compound.

A series of critical reviews and perspectives focussing on specific aspects of organometallic chemistry interfacing with other fields of study are provided. For this volume, the critical reviews cover topics such as the activation of "inert" carbon-hydrogen bonds, ligand design and organometallic radical species. For example, Charlie O'Hara discusses how mixed-metal compounds may perform the highly selective activation of C-H bonds and, in particular, how synergic relationships between various metals

4. Polymer Chemistry
Polymer chemistry first introduced in 1777 for Henri Braconnot work which produced nitrocellulose and developed by Christian Schönbein in 1846 which led to the discovery of celluloid. Even though has been studied over decades it did need some longer time for universities introduced teaching and researching it until 1940 when an “Institut fur Makromolekulare Chemie” was founded in Freiburg, Germany which concentrate in study of Polymer Chemistry or known macromolecular chemistry. A year later PRI (Polymer Research Intitute) was established in America.
Polymer chemistry it self is a multi-disciplinary study focusing on chemical synthesis , chemical structures, and macromolecule. Polymer study explain the characteristic of a material, according to IUPAC(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) macromolecules refer to individual molecule chain that is domain of chemistry.
There are two major classification of polymer first is biopolymers which naturally can be found in human life such as structural protein, enzym, hormones, cellulose, DNA,RNA etc. The other one is synthetic polymer which is developed in laboratory such as thermoplastic, teflon, polystyrene, thermosetting plastic such as kevlar,bakelite, vulcanized rubber etc.

BOOKS:
The subject of this book is covered in seven chapters. The chapters are arranged in an attempt to reflect the three pillars of materials science and technology: in materials, there is a strong link between processing, microstructure and properties. Changing one affects the others and this has enabled scientists/engineers to tailor materials to suit purposes.

5. Inorganic Chemistry
Inorganic Chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the structure and interactions between inorganic compounds, which are any compounds that aren’t based in carbon-hydrogen bonds. Inorganic chemistry is concerned with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds. While organic chemistry is defined as the study of carbon-containing compounds and inorganic chemistry is the study of the remaining subset of compounds other than organic compounds, there is overlap between the two fields (such as organometallic compounds, which usually contain a metal or metalloid bonded directly to carbon).

6. Bioengineering:
Biological engineering or bio-engineering (including biological systems engineering) is the application of concepts and methods of biology (and secondarily of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science) to solve real-world problems related to life sciences or the application thereof, using engineering's own analytical and synthetic methodologies and also its traditional sensitivity to the cost and practicality of the solution(s) arrived at. In this context, while traditional engineering applies physical and mathematical sciences to analyze, design and manufacture inanimate tools, structures and processes, biological engineering uses primarily the rapidly developing body of knowledge known as molecular biology to study and advance applications of organisms and to create biotechnology.

7. Physical Chemistry
Branches of Physical Chemistry involves the branching of chemical elements that pertaining physics to the study of chemistry. Quantum theories and thermodynamics nuclear are the byproduct of physical chemical subject. Physical chemistry is the study of how matter behaves on a molecular and ionic level and how chemical reactions happened. Based on their research, physical chemists may built new application, such as how complex integrity are tied together.
