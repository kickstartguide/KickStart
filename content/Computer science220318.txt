Computer science & IT
Programming Languages : A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.
C 
C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.
C++ 
Objects. C++ introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) features to C. It offers classes, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Java
It is an object oriented language. Its syntax is common as C and C++. It was released in 1995 as a part of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. Java programs are compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making Java a platform independent programming language.
Python
Python is a general purpose programming language created in the late 1980s, and named after Monty Python, that's used by thousands of people to do things from testing microchips at Intel, to powering Instagram, to building video games with the PyGame library.
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. 
Deep Learning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
Data Science
Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining.
Machine Learning
Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computer systems the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.
Computer Graphics
Photoshop
Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll.
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by AdobeSystems. The latest version, Illustrator CC 2018, is the 22nd generation in the product line.
Corel
CorelDraw is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Corel Corporation. It is also the name of Corel's Graphics Suite, which bundles CorelDraw with bitmap-image editor Corel Photo-Paint as well as other graphics-related programs.
After Effects
Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application developed by Adobe Systems and used in the post-production process of film making and television production.
Network Security
Cisco
Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) is an intermediate-level certification in the Cisco certified professional program. This certification is aimed at full-time network or system administrators, or those who work with local and/or wide-area network (LAN/WAN)infrastructure.
Wireshark
Wireshark is a free and open source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.
Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security
Ethical hacking is testing the IT resources for a good cause and the betterment of technology. Ethical hackers are none other than computer security experts and researchers who focus on penetration testing and weaknesses in the organization's information systems they associated.
Database
Sql/PlSql
SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.
Sql Server
SQL Server is Microsoft's relational database management system (RDBMS). It is a full-featured database primarily designed to compete against competitors Oracle Database (DB) and MySQL.
Database Management
Database Management System: The software which is used to manage database is called Database Management System (DBMS). For Example, MySQL, Oracle etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications.
Web Development
HTML
Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
JavaScript
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It is originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.

python
learning to program with python---- Richard L. Halterman
15) This book does not attempt to cover all the facets of the Python programming language. Experienced programmers should look elsewhere for books that cover Python in much more detail. The focus here is on introducing programming techniques and developing good habits. To that end, our approach avoids some of the more esoteric features of Python and concentrates on the programming basics that transfer directly to other imperative programming languages such as Java, C#, and C++. We stick with the basics and explore more advanced features of Python only when necessary to handle the problem at hand.The code in this book is based on Python 3

Machine Learning
Pattern recognisation and machine learning-----Christopher Bishop
41) This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory
42) http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf
Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning-----David Barber
43) This book concentrates on the probabilistic aspects of information processing and machine learning. Certainly no claim is made as to the correctness or that this is the only useful approach. Indeed, one might counter that this is unnecessary since “biological organisms don’t use probability theory”. Whether this is the case or not, it is undeniable that the framework of graphical models and probability has helped with the explosion of new algorithms and models in the machine learning community. One should also be clear that Bayesian viewpoint is not the only way to go about describing machine learning and information processing.
